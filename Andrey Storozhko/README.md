POKEDEX
=====================

This is my final project at the Epam training.

### Usage
**Clone this repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/AndreyS55/Pokedex.git
```

**Install**
```
npm install
```

**Start the application in development mode**
```
npm run start
```
This command will start json-server on http://localhost:3000 and application on http://localhost:3030

**Start tests**
```
npm run test
```

**Start linter**
```
npm run lint
```

**When ready, build for production**
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a minimized bundle.js file in the `public` folder.
Project JavaScript files are bundled from the `src` folder.
